# XORcrypt
A javascript encryption library using XOR (exclusive or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or). This is a one time pad type of encryption where each key can only be used once, creating proven, uncrackable encryption. This is for use in web proojects that would benefit from end to end encryption, adding another level of security.

XORcrypt is a WIP and may not be secure. Use With Caution.
